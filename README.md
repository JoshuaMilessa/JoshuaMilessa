# Welcome to My GitHub

- Aspiring Quant Developer & Researcher | C++ • Python • Financial Modeling  
- Building tools and strategies for systematic trading and quantitative research  
- Strong foundation in quantitative strategies, financial concepts, and market instruments  
- Studied for the CFA Program — strong grasp of finance, economics, and investment analysis

I'm currently learning to develop robust algorithmic trading systems and conduct quantitative research using C++ and Python. My work combines financial theory, data science, and software development to better understand and model financial markets.

## Key Competencies
- Quantitative strategies: mean reversion, momentum, statistical arbitrage  
- Financial concepts: derivatives, risk/return, portfolio theory, market microstructure  
- Instruments: equities, options, futures, ETFs  

## Current Focus
- Linux VPS Deployment Toolkit
- Exploratory research into alpha models, risk models, transaction cost models, portfolio models, and execution models
- High-Frequency Trade Engine

## Career Goal
To join a quant team where I can contribute to both research and development—bridging the gap between math and execution—while continuing to grow in algorithmic trading, financial theory, and computational finance.

## Tools & Skills in Progress
- Git & GitHub for professional project management  
- Statistical methods, optimization, and risk modeling  
- Machine learning applied to financial data
