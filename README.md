🔍 Aspiring Quant Developer & Researcher | C++ • Python • Financial Modeling  
📈 Building tools and strategies for systematic trading and quantitative research  
📚 Strong foundation in quantitative strategies, financial concepts, and market instruments  

I'm currently learning to develop robust algorithmic trading systems and conduct quantitative research using C++ and Python. My work combines financial theory, data science, and software development to better understand and model financial markets.

🧠 Key competencies:
- Quantitative strategies: mean reversion, momentum, statistical arbitrage  
- Financial concepts: derivatives, risk/return, portfolio theory, microstructure  
- Instruments: equities, options, futures, ETFs  

🚀 Current focus:
- Event-driven backtesting engine (C++)
- Exploratory research into alpha-generating signals
- Building tools for data ingestion, cleaning, and visualization

🎯 Career goal:
To join a quant team where I can contribute to both research and development—bridging the gap between math and execution—while continuing to grow in algorithmic trading, financial theory, and computational finance.

🛠️ Tools & Skills in Progress:
- Git & GitHub for professional project management  
- Statistical methods, optimization, and risk modeling  
- Machine learning applied to financial data

Let’s connect, collaborate, and solve complex problems with code and insight.
